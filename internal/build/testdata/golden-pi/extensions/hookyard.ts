// One fixed template plus exactly one spliced value. Every install-specific
// string — router path, state directory, event names, matchers — arrives inside
// DATA as json.Marshal output, so a hostile handler string lands as JSON data
// and can never become code. Nothing else is ever concatenated into this
// source (§8).
//
// Plain ESM JavaScript under a .ts name, and both halves are load-bearing:
// `node --check` can parse plain JS, which is the only gate in this repo that
// looks at this file at all, and pi loads it through jiti regardless of the
// extension. No type annotations, no type-only imports.
//
// Node builtins only. The bridge sits in pi's config directory with no
// node_modules beside it, so a value import from the pi package would throw at
// load — and an extension that throws at load takes down every extension pi
// would have loaded after it.

// execFile for a router — it buffers the reply and the bridge waits for it —
// and spawn for a command's exec, which is neither buffered nor waited for.
